## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Your instructor will briefly discuss the changeover to a new skill drill platform next week, and a poll you can fill in to get some free-ish marks.

Getting as many drills done as you can!

## CHANGING THE SKILL DRILL PLATFORM

I mentioned earlier in the semester that we were going to try out **two** different skill drill platforms this semester - the time to switch is soon upon us: we'll be moving to **Qualified.io** next Thursday.

Before we leave **REPL.IT**, I'd like to get some feedback from you folks in order to help decide which platform (if any!) will be used in future runnings of 1501.

I will be releasing a brief questionnaire shortly - I'll be announcing it on Blackboard. Students who _thoughtfully_ answer it before October 24 will be able to turn **six** late drill submissions to **on time** submissions. I will be doing this again near the end of the semester to get your feedback on the Qualified platform, meaning that you will be able to convert a total of **12** late submissions - which works out to be a "free" 1% added to your final course grade. (If you don't think 1% is a lot, you've never been _just_ shy of something. It sucks.)

For those who do not need the conversion (because you've kept up or have fewer lates to convert), I will be providing an equivalent straight-up bonus to your mark at the end of the semester.
